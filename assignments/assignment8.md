# Homework: Find a story

I found that the Fraternal Order of Police has given around $140,000 to federal candidates in the past three cycles. The majority of 
the donations have gone to Democratic PACs, with those affilated with Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD), Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).

With protests against police brutality sweeping the nation, police unions have been widely criticized for thier opposition to reform. Yet Democrats, who typically voice more support for police reform, have actually been the greater recipients of political donations from the FOP. Sen. Klobuchar, whose PACs received $12,500 from the FOP, has had her record 
as Hennepin County attorney come under fire for how her office handled police accused of wrongdoing. I will look at donations from other police unions, as well as lobbying records 
to get an idea of the police union's influence on Capitol Hill. I would also reach out to the major recipients of police union donations and the FOP itself.

1. I searched for "Fraternal Order of Police" in the FEC database, and included the last three cycles (since 2015)
2. I imported the CSV into Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WPKPwbefD5EInUqkmSh23lx4KvU4kw80c37yk9bHYN8/edit#gid=181445676
3. I looked up each receiving PAC to see which candidate/party it was affiliated with.
4. I created a pivot table to break down donations by party and candidate.

Headline: Police unions donated over $100,000 to national Democrats in recent cycles

Nut graf: The Fraternal Order of Police donated three times as much to Democrats as Republicans in recent years, 
even as they have opposed police reforms that have become mainstream in the Democratic party.
