## Assignment 3: Collecting your own data

There's been a lot of shake-ups in Chicago media in recent years, so I wanted to create a dataset of ownership transfers, 
openings and closings of Chicago publications and media outlets. The state of local news is an increasingly pressing issue - one 
that's been exacerbated by coronavirus - and this dataset could provide the backbone of a story/graphic that lays out 
how Chicago's media landscape has changed and what might be next. In terms of collecting the data, Wikipedia is a good first step,
and then sources and details can be picked out of news articles that cover the events or from the "About" section of the publications themselves.

For each data point, I collected the year the event took place, the name of the publication affected, the event type (e.g. ownership transfer or shuttering) 
and the previous owner, new owner, and new name (if applicable).
