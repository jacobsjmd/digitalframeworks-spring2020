# Topic idea 1: Payday lenders
What communities are payday lenders located in/targeting? The common knowledge is that payday lenders target communities of color, rural areas and poorer areas, but it would be interesting to see data-driven analysis and a map that actually visualizes that distribution. If I could get locations of all the payday lenders in the state/county/city, it could be tied to census data to answer that question. 

The current crisis adds another dimension to the issue of payday lenders, since many people will likely have difficulty paying off their existing loans, or may be forced to take out new loans in order to make ends meet. In addition, many states have deemed payday lenders an “essential business,” so another angle would be to have a 50-state map that shows how different states are treating payday lenders during this crisis.

### Clarity and Accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? - **2**
  * It's easy to see the disparities between certain regions, although they give a few insights at the bottom that could have been incorporated into the map, such as how race factors in and the definitions of "Credit-assured”, “credit-insecure” and “credit-at-risk" communities.

* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? - **3**
  * It’s easy to hover over and see a percentage, but it would be nice to have some context to that percentage in the tooltip, such as how it compares to the state average or what classification that percentage falls under.

* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? - **4**
  * They link to the data source - a report by the New York Fed, which seems reliable. However, I do feel like they should have added a disclaimed that credit insecurity could vary greatly within counties based on inequality, segregation, etc., since the overall averages might be misleading.

### Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? - **2**
  * I feel like this was a bit of a lazy story - they took the data from the report and pasted it into a map. The map might be useful for those who simply need to find some numbers on credit insecurity, but it doesn’t do a great job of putting the data in context or correlating it with other factors that might lead to credit insecurity.

* Considering color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?  - **3**
  * The type is easy to read, and I think the color range makes sense - it’s easy to pick out the worst counties. However, the shades are not equally spaced in terms of percentage, and it would be nice if the colors more closely correlated with/indicated the classification of communities (“Credit-assured”, “credit-insecure” vs “credit-at-risk”)

### Creativity
* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect?  - 1
  * They pretty much just copied and pasted the data from the report. While the report is on an interesting topic, they didn’t do much to expand on it or look at it creatively.


# Topic idea 2: Section 8 waitlists
How long are people sitting on Section 8 waitlists, and how do different areas compare?
I’ve regularly heard or read about people waiting years for Section 8 vouchers, typically in major cities facing affordable housing crises. However, I have never seen a visualization of how different areas compare. I could compare different major metro regions, or compare different areas in Illinois.

There are also criticisms that vouchers do not cover of the cost of housing in regions with high rents. Another angle on this story/visualization would be to combine Section 8 voucher amount data with rent/wage data to see if these vouchers are actually making housing affordable enough for those who need it.

[Rents rise, supply drops — Chicago’s affordable housing woes mount](https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/blair-kamin/ct-biz-affordable-housing-chicago-kamin0424-story.html) (Chicago Tribune)


### Clarity and Accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? - **4**
  * It’s clear that there are affordable housing declines in several areas in Chicago.

* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? - **2**
  * It’s not initially clear that you can click on the regions to see the exact percentages. The tooltips also include overall percentages of affordable housing stock, which would be useful to visualize in some way. Since the map relies only on percentage change, it lumps areas with 55% affordable units with 15%, just because they had a similar rate of change.

* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? - **4**
  * The study the data is based on seems reliable, and they report on some of the key findings in the study, and link to the full text.

### Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? - **3**
  * I think it does a solid job of giving an overview of the report, sharing some data as well as anecdotal evidence for the affordable housing shortage. I do feel like the bullet points with key findings could be handled better, since they share the same format as the rest of the story, but then suddenly it jumps back into anecdotes.

* Considering color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?  - **1**
  * I don’t think blue is an appropriate color for a decrease in affordable housing stock - I think red would be more appropriate to show decline. The light yellow is also hard to see, and could blend in with the gray regions that are outside the city.

### Creativity
* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect?  - **2**
  * I think they did a decent job of adding anecdotes to accompany an important report, but I do think that the graphics aren’t particularly creative. If you go to the report, you see a nearly identical interactive map at the bottom that actually looks a bit more polished (although has some similar color issues).
