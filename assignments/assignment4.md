# Story Pitch

I'd like to create an interactive map of COVID-19 in nursing homes. As part of the Medill Investigative Lab class, 
I've been helping maintain a [database](https://wpinvestigative.github.io/nursing_homes_covid19/index.html) of affected homes 
nationwide. I'd like to make a nationwide map, but if that ends up being unfeasible, I could focus on a single hard-hit state.

Since the database incudes a federal id from CMS, the address can be easily looked up and converted into geographic coordinates.
Additionally, our lab has been doing a lot of reporting on nursing homes this quarter, so I have a number of experts and sources 
I could get context/anecdotes from.

Nursing homes have been devastated by the virus, and an interactive map would be a powerful tool to see the scale of the crisis, 
and even check whether a local nursing home has been affected. Reporting by states has been spotty, and those that have reported lists 
often do so with PDFs or dashboards that are difficult to search through. The searchable table on GitHub is more useful, but 
still lacks the visual element of a map.
